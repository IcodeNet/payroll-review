## Overview
The domain layer implements the core business logic and entities for the payroll system. The current implementation shows an attempt at Domain-Driven Design (DDD) but has several areas for improvement.

## Current Issues

1. **Poor Encapsulation**
   - Public setters on entities
   - Direct access to internal state
   - No validation on property changes
   - Missing invariant checks

2. **Domain Model Weaknesses**
   - Missing value objects
   - No domain events
   - Poor business rules enforcement
   - Mutable properties without validation

3. **Inheritance Issues**
   - Unclear inheritance strategy
   - Base class handling derived-specific logic
   - Missing abstract methods for specialization

## Current Implementation

### Aggregates
1. Employee (Root)
   - Manages employee information and state
   - Handles contract types and holiday allowance
   - Contains payment history

2. Department
   - Manages department structure
   - Contains employee assignments
   - Handles department hierarchy

### Value Objects
1. Money
   - Handles currency and amounts
   - Prevents floating-point errors
   - Implements proper equality

2. DateRange
   - Manages date periods
   - Validates start/end dates
   - Calculates durations

## Detailed Issues

### 1. Aggregate Design
- Unclear aggregate boundaries
- Missing invariant checks
- Poor encapsulation
- Inconsistent state management

### 2. Domain Events
- Missing critical events
- Incomplete audit trail
- Poor event documentation
- Inconsistent event handling

### 3. Business Rules
- Rules spread across classes
- Missing validation
- Inconsistent enforcement
- Poor documentation

### 4. Value Objects
- Limited use
- Missing for complex values
- Inconsistent implementation
- Poor validation

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement Rich Domain Model
   - Move business logic to entities
   - Use private setters and encapsulation
   - Implement value objects
   - Add domain events

### 2. Add Domain Validation
   - Implement invariant checks
   - Use value objects for validation
   - Add domain-specific exceptions

### 3. Implement Domain Services
   - Add services for complex operations
   - Implement proper transaction handling
   - Add proper error handling

### 4. Add Specifications
   - Implement specification pattern
   - Add reusable business rules

### 5. Implement Proper Aggregates
   - Define clear boundaries
   - Implement proper relationships
   - Add consistency rules

### 6. Value Objects
   - Expand usage
   - Add missing objects
   - Standardize implementation
   - Add proper validation

## Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Foundations
   - Implement base classes
   - Add core value objects
   - Define interfaces

2. Phase 2: Business Rules
   - Implement validation
   - Add rule enforcement
   - Document rules

3. Phase 3: Events
   - Add domain events
   - Implement handlers
   - Add audit trail

4. Phase 4: Refinement
   - Review boundaries
   - Add documentation
   - Implement testing
